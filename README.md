# uber_backend_application


## Description:

The Uber Backend Application is a web-based application built using the Spring Boot framework, Java programming 
language, MySQL database, Hibernate ORM, JPA (Java Persistence API), and Swagger/Postman. The application is 
designed to manage all Uber operations, including registering drivers, registering customers, booking trips, 
completing trips, canceling trips, and deleting drivers.

The application consists of 15+ RESTful APIs that are designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. These APIs 
include registering drivers, registering customers, booking trips, completing trips, canceling trips, and deleting drivers.

The project is structured using Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. 
This structure enables efficient communication between the server and client and streamlines the development process.
DTOs are used to transfer data between layers, and MVC is used to separate business logic from presentation logic.

The project also uses Swagger/Postman to document and test the RESTful APIs. This provides a standardized way of 
accessing and manipulating data and ensures that the APIs are consistent and reliable.

The system is designed to be secure, scalable, and easy to use. It improves the efficiency of Uber operations and 
enhances the user experience for drivers and customers. The integration of JPA and Hibernate ORM provides a standard
way of managing database persistence and allows for the efficient mapping of Java objects to relational data.
